<h2> Conclusions </h2>
<p> Based on the findings of the experiment, Carb Cutter was successful in slowing the breakdown of starch by the enzyme amylase (Tables 1-2). By initially evaluating the trendlines in the graphs, it can be determined that Carb Cutter slowed the decrease in starch concentration over time compared to the normal reaction. This is because the slope of the Carb Cutter graph is lesser than the slope of the normal reaction graph. This indicates that there is a slower rate of change in the Carb Cutter reaction compared to the normal reaction. This is further supported by the data found in the results of the experiment which show that the rate of change in the normal reaction was .338 mg/ml per minute compared to the rate of change in the Carb Cutter reaction which was .075 mg/ml per minute. This proves that our hypothesis for this experiment was correct in that Carb Cutter would be successful in slowing the breakdown on starch by the enzyme amylase. </p>
<p> The conclusion of this experiment indicates that the dietary supplement Carb Cutter was successful is slowing the breakdown of starch by the enzyme amylase. This information is useful for the purpose of investigating the claim that dietary supplements aid weight loss in humans. However, this experiment only proves that Carb Cutter, which uses a specific ingredient known as Phaselous vulgaris which uses alpha-amylase inhibitors to prevent starch digestion by completely blocking access to the active site of the amylase enzyme, measurably slows the breakdown of starch (Barrett et al., 2011). There were several limitations to this experiment such as lack of experimentation using other ingredients that have similar effects to Phaselous vulgaris. Another limitation would be being unable to determine the exact rate of change needed in order to justify the significant effectiveness of a given dietary supplement in promoting weight loss in humans (Onakpoya et al., 2011). These limitations and others must be further investigated in order to fully support the claim that dietary supplements are effective in aiding weight loss. </p>
