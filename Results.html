<p> Starch concentrations decreased linearly over time in both the normal and Carb Cutter reactions (Tables 1-2). However, the decrease of the starch concentration in the Carb Cutter reaction was slower compared to the normal reactions decrease in starch concentration. Also, the rate of change of the starch concentration over time was higher in the normal reaction compared to the Carb Cutter reaction. The rate of change in the normal reaction was .338 mg/ml per minute and the rate of change in the Carb Cutter reaction was .075 mg/ml per minute. </p>
